For this week we were able to work on our first blog post as a group. We split the roles into three as editors, developers, and admostrarors. I was one of the admistrtors. I have learned abpout WordPress and adding Markup. WordPress seems to be a more organized CMS than Hugo.
* I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
* I can describe and compare content management systems.
* I can manage content using established workflows.
* I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
* I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
