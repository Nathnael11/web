### Module 7
For this week i was able to
* Find and use resources for self-directed learning. We read about evaluating and rating CMS's
* Identify and employ technologies related to content management. We are using Wordpress to complete our weekly blog posts.
* Manage content using established workflows. We meet as a group and talked about what our roles are going to be for the blog post. Me and Hassan have been assigned the developer role. This week i worked with my group as an editor and published the Blog post for week 8. The post i recieved was from Britanny and it was about the new surveilence system that apple had created. I used WordPress to publish the post and also added a picture and link to the original article to provide more context. I then notifed Carli who took up the admoinstrator rile this week about the post and she was able to look over it and clear it. I also looked into Tumblr for one of the discussion posts and was interested in what i saw. I am working with my team and getting familiar with Microsoft Teams. We have started using the Planner application an it is very useful in organizing our tasks. 

This week I did not
* Identify and define key concepts in (web) content management. 
* Describe and compare content management systems.
