This week i worked with my group as an editor and published the Blog post for week 8. The post i recieved was from Britanny and it was about the new surveilence system that apple had created. I used WordPress to publish the post and also added a picture and link to the original article to provide more context. I then notifed Carli who took up the admoinstrator rile this week about the post and she was able to look over it and clear it. I also looked into Tumblr for one of the discussion posts and was interested in what i saw. 
Here is a picture that i addes to the blog post
